# Yorkshire & the Humber University Accommodation University Scheme (YAHUAS)

Code for Databases (YSJ second year second semester module) creative artefact.
### Background

A range of universities in Yorkshire & Humberside, wish to centralise the university accommodation and facilities across the region, in order to optimise on utilisation and lower operating costs of accommodation.  The director of the scheme requires a bespoke centralised database solution available at each university’s accommodation office. 

### Aim
To present a final prototype solution, focusing on the backend database administrative tasks and management reporting via a web interface.

### Task 

1. Undertake the appropriate analysis of YAHUAS, and  demonstrate this with an Entity-Relationship Diagram.
2. Devise a completed logical model using the relational principles, and normalisation.
3. Create a metadata schema, detailing all the formats for all your data items including any verification and validations, in preparation for implementation.
4. Based on your design documentation, build a database solution for YAHUAS.  Write SQL scripts to alter, insert, delete, search data for YAHUAS.
5. Construct a simple, effective web interface (using CSS, HTML5 and PHP) for your database solution. 
6. Design and implement a PHP web form for inserting data.
7. Design, write, and test relevant SQL queries that will provide information that meets YAHUAS’s operational, tactical and strategic needs (range of 5-10). 
8. Include a navigational object in your web interface to run a range of queries created and create the PHP programs to present the results.

### Tools
The PHPMyAdmin/MYSQL Workbench/MYSQL console backend is hosted on XAMPP.

The front end is built on HTML5, CSS, and PHP, as the use of javascript was prohibited.
